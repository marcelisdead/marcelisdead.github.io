<p>Marcel Bornstein 
<br>is an artist 
<br>and game developer
<br>from NYC.

<br>Obsessed with exploring
<br>the bounds of human 
<br>creativity and communication.
</p>

<p>
As a sculptor, i created with steel, concrete, and stone, but i also thought a lot about humanity's objects and our experience with them. i came to realize that we would soon step out of the limits of physical reality. In the decade plus since, through dedicated self-study, i have also become an XR Developer, Programmer, and Futurist. My work includes an AR collaborative layer on the planet, award-winning MR applications, and a VR Action-Adventure-Arcade game currently in development.
