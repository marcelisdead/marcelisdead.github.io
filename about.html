                    <p>Hello! i am marcel bornstein an artist and xr game developer from NYC.</p>
                    <p>i've created with steel (bad signs), concrete (graveyard), and stone (balloon) but most of my work as a sculptor used found objects (recreationism) and played with the idea of them (match in water). </p>
                    <p>In thinking about humanity's objects and our experience with them, i came to realize that we would soon step out of the limits of physical reality. That we and our objects would exist in both a digital and physical space and that the ideas of objects would then get to exist in space with us. Not to mention that we could  also journey into the space of ideas ourselves.</p>
                    <p>Through my own exploration since 2013 i am XR Developer, Programmer, Game Designer and Futurist. My work includes an AR collaborative layer on the planet (Babel), award-winning MR applications (LoopJam), and a VR Action-Adventure-Arcade game (Server Update) currently in development.</p>
